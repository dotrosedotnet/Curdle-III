# Curdle-III

A Curses Wordle written in Python

This is my third attempt at an elegant, effective curses
Wordle (Curdle) in Python.

I love the terminal, and curses, and am finally learning to
program. I've learned a lot from my first two attempts, and
would love to finalize something that I'm proud of with this
one.

Some hopes for this attempt:

- [ ] appropriate use of for loops, functions
- [ ] clean, readable code
- [ ] separation of processes
	- [ ] separate guess creation from guess printing
	- [ ] separate guess feedback from guess creation/printing
		- [ ] feedback in grid (letter in word/not in word/in
				the correct position)
		- [ ] feedback in keyboard representation of letters
				guessed
- [ ] learn more!
